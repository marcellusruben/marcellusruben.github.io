														<h3>Trajectory Reconstruction and Video Analysis for Kinematic Assessment and FEM Validation in Passive Safety Application</h3>
													</header>
													<p>There are lots of uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the data coming from a sensor and it is difficult to know its exact initial orientation. <br><br> The solution for this problem is to compare the data from sensor with the data from Finite Element (FE) video, then run an optimization algorithm to minimize the error in the sensor's data.</p>

														<h3>Lear CC-SC Project</h3>
													</header>
													<p>CC-SC is an important procedure in the design phase that the design and project engineer at Lear need to do before deploying a proposal regarding the final design of vehicle seat structure. <br><br> For a seat structure, it is particularly important to check how many welds can be considered as CC and SC.

														If a weld is considered as CC, it means that this weld carries a heavy amount of load so that a regular maintenance regarding this weld is necessary.<br><br> In this project, the script to automatize the report generation of CC-SC welds based on raw FE data is implemented</p>

														<h3>Understanding Jakarta Flooding Using Data</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Flood is an ever-present problem in Jakarta and it occurs annually or even monthly there. To understand this phenomenon, relevant data are used to answer these questions:<br><br>

														1. What is the possible explanatory variable for floods? <br>
														2. Can we actually predict the amount of subdistricts or people that will be affected by flood just by looking at the rainfall rate?<br>
														3. Which districts that we should focus our attention to when the heavy rainfall pours down the city?<br>
														4. Are the amount of parks in a given district actually helpful to mitigate the floods?

														<h3>The Fundamentals of Reinforcement LEarning</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Reinforcement learning is probably one of the most relatable scientific approaches that resemble the way humans learn about things. Every day, we, the learner, learn by interacting with our environment to know what to do in certain situations, to know about the consequences of our actions, and so on.

														When we were babies, we didn’t know that touching a hot kettle would hurt our hand. However, as we learned about how the environment responded to our action, i.e touching the hot kettle hurts our hand, then we learned not to touch a hot kettle. This illustrates the fundamental theory of reinforcement learning.</p>

														<h3>My Story of Taking the TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam</h3>
													</header>
													<p>To be honest, I had not known that TensorFlow offers a certification exam until I saw someone tweeted about it on Twitter. I did some research to find out more about the exam and I said to myself: This is going to be my next goal in my journey of exploring the world of machine learning.<br><br>

														In this article, I want to talk about my personal experience of taking the TensorFlow Developer Certification exam and how I prepared for it. I hope that this article will be helpful to anyone of you who are interested in taking the exam in the near future.</p>

														<h3>The Curious Case of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Hive</h3>
													</header>
													<p>In an era of Big Data where the amount, size, and velocity of data are rapidly growing, knowing SQL is still an essential thing for Data Analyst and Data Scientist to know. SQL helps us to manage data in a traditional relational database (RDBMS), distributed cluster, or even in a cloud environment.<br><br>

														If we are dealing with data in a traditional RDBMS, more often than not we are going to use DB engines like MySQL or PostgreSQL. However, as the amount and size of data are rapidly growing, we can’t store all of the data solely with RDBMS. This is where we need the distributed cluster to store and process a massive amount of data and Hadoop facilitated it for us.</p>

														<h3>Deploying an Image Classification Web App with Python</h3>
													</header>
													<p>It is no doubt that doing a data science and machine learning project, starting from collecting the data, processing the data, visualizing insights about the data, and developing a machine learning model to do a predictive task is a fun thing to do. What makes it more fun and doable is that we can do all of those steps in our local machine and then be done with it.<br><br>

														However, wouldn’t it be awesome if other people can make use of our machine learning model to do fun and cool stuff? The true magic of machine learning comes when our model can get into other people’s hand and they can do useful stuff from it.</p>

														<h3>Treating Linear Regression More Than Just a Black Box</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Linear regression is one of the most basic machine learning models out there, yet its application is everywhere: from predicting housing prices to predicting movie ratings. Even when you’re taking a cab to go to work, you have a linear regression problem to deal with.<br><br>

														Simply put, linear regression relates to the linear relationship between the predicted value and feature value. </p>

														<h3>Recommendation System: An Introduction</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Believe it or not, recommendation system is one of the most successful and widely used machine learning application in real world business problems.<br><br>

														As an example, I often read funny comments on a Youtube video stating that people find out about a particular video not because they searched it explicitly, but because “Youtube algorithm” recommended it to them. I find it fascinating that the recommendation system allows you to find relevant videos that you might never find had it never been recommended to you.</p>
